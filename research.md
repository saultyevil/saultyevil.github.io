My main research interests is radiative transfer in astrophysics and tidal
disruption events. For my Ph.D, I modelled the radiative transfer through
an optically thick outflow of thermal photons emitted from a tidal disruption
event's accretion disc. The focus was to understand the influence reprocessing
by such optically thick winds has on the frequency distribution of the light
which escapes. My other main research interest is using high performance
computing and parallel processing techniques in research software, to tackle
problems which previously could not realistically be solved.
