My main research interest is radiative transfer in tidal
disruption events, as well as in other compact accreting objects such as
Active Galactic Nuclei and Cataclysmic variables. In my Ph.D, I modelled the
radiative transfer of photons through an optically thick accretion disc wind
from a tidal disruption event. The aims of my research are to understand the
influence the outflow has on the spectroscopic properties of tidal disruption
events. Most specifically, I am interested in if reprocessing by the outflow
is responsible for what we observe from these events, e.g. if reprocessing may
be responsible for producing the optically bright spectra of a sub-set of tidal
disruption events. But I am also interested in if outflows are also responsible
for the dichotomy of absorption and emission line spectra in the ultraviolet
spectra of tidal disruption events and other compact accreting objects.

My other research interest is the interface between scientific research and
software engineering. I am interested in using high performance computing and
parallel processing techniques to tackle research problems which could not
be solved otherwise.
