Kris is a simple terminal based text editor written in C, based on the text
editor Kilo. Kris supports reading and writing files, as well as including
syntax highlighting for C, Fortran and Python and the ability to dynamically
search the texxt buffer. The project is named after my cat, Kris. Here is a 
*very* cute picture of him.

# Next Generational Computational Modelling

As part of the Next Generational Modelling Centre of Doctoral Training (NGCM-CDT),
the first year of my PhD included a taught masters year in computational and
numerical techniques. The image is of some simulated hair, created by solving a 
system of differential equations.
