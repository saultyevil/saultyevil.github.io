#### Abstract

When an unlucky star wanders too close to a supermassive black hole, the self-gravity keeping that star together
is completely overwhelmed by the tidal forces of the interaction and is torn asunder in something known as a tidal
disruption event (TDE). The fallback of the stellar debris, and subsequent accretion, onto the black hole drives a
powerful, but transient, luminous flare visible across the electromagnetic spectrum: a shining light, even in death.
Within the past decade, the census of TDEs has rapidly grown to a dizzying 56 events. Theoretical progress, on the
other hand, has somewhat lagged behind and our understanding of these events is held back by our ignorance of the
emission mechanisms fuelling the luminous flare.

Given their extreme luminosities, TDEs are expected to generate  significant mass loss in the form of radiation driven
winds, but their properties remain poorly understood even though their importance is widely acknowledged. In this
thesis, I use state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer and ionization software to model the profound impact such
powerful outflows have on the optical and ultraviolet (UV) spectra of these events. Focusing exclusively on the
sub-Eddington accretion phase, I first show how the diverse family of UV spectra, showcasing broad absorption and
emission lines, can be unified as an orientation effect associated with line formation in an accretion disc wind. And if
true, I suggest that the relative number of broad absorption to emission line TDEs could be used to estimate the
outflow covering fraction.

I also demonstrate how such outflows can efficiently reprocess the accretion disc emission, producing the broad Balmer
and helium optical recombination features characteristic of TDEs, as well as a spectral energy distribution (SED) with
a much lower characteristic colour temperature. I next apply the exact same numerical techniques to post-process a
snapshot of a realistic hydrodynamic model of the super-Eddington accretion phase, illustrating how different
reprocessing regimes can modify the SED and influence the observable signatures of TDEs.

In summary, then, this thesis demonstrates how optically thick outflows impact and shape the observational properties of
TDEs, and why, in the future, detailed radiative transfer calculations are required to understand the complexities of
TDE emission.
