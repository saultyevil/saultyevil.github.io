We explore how perturbing pulses interact in extragalactic jets, focusing on
any movement of the shock fronts. This is done using a simple 2D
hydrodynamical model used to simulate inviscid, axisymmetric jets using the
software PLUTO. We model a number of light, low Mach number jets over a
range of pressure ratios to create overexpanded, underexpanded and pressure
matched jets, injecting sinusoidal pulse patterns with varying amplitudes and
frequencies. These pulses cause shock fronts with higher strength than those of
the internal jet shock fronts. Pulses are found to eject jet material into the
surrounding ambient medium and in some cases can severely disrupt the structure
of the jets. Our simulations show an interesting behaviour where pulses cause
internal shock fronts to move within the jet structure. We found that pulses
with an amplitude of F = 0.5 and frequency of ω = π cause the largest shock front
movement and that the length of pulse injection affects the total amount of
shock front movement. It is proposed that a feedback loop of turbulent energy
from the pulses and ejected jet material, as it is entrained back into the jet,
is the source of this shock front oscillation.
