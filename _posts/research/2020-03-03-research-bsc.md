This project aimed to find nearby stars and brown dwarfs by searching for high
proper motion stars which are objects that move with a large angular displacement
across the sky each year. Candidate stars were found using H2-K images
from the UKIDSS GPS and UWISH2. The spectral type and distance of these objects
was also determined by using their JHK magnitudes from UKIDSS GPS, colour indices
and the distance modulus. The highest proper motion object found had µ = 97 ± 38 mas/yr
and was found to be 39 ± 9 parsecs away, hence no  high proper motion objects
were found. The majority of objects found were M type stars but 2 L-type brown dwarfs
were found. These L-type dwarfs were also the closest with distances at 3 ± 1 and
6 ± 1 parsecs. These two objects were determined to be unreliable/unrealistic
discoveries as they were close to the saturation limit of the detector which can
result in inaccurate magnitude measurements.
