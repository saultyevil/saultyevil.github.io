#### Description

This project consists of the same radiative transfer model implemented using
different programming styles and languages. The model consists of a single
1D semi-infinite slab of material, which a purely scattering and grey atmosphere.
The output is the intensity as a function of angle and moments of the radiation
field as a function of depth in the slab. These programs provide a helpful
sandbox environment, or stepping stone, for developing more complicated and
physically realistic simulations. For example, my other project
<img src="../img/github.png" alt="" width="28"/> <a href="https://github.com/saultyevil/VarianceReduction">Variance Reduction</a>
uses the Python class based approach to test the performance of variance reduction
methods in MCRT simulations, and my other project
<img src="../img/github.png" alt="" width="28"/> <a href="https://github.com/saultyevil/Minji">Minji</a>,
uses the C implementation as a stepping stone to simulating 3D photon transport.

#### Technology

C, Python, Rust
