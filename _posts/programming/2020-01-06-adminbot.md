### Description

adminbot is a bot designed to automatically moderate moderators in a Discord server
and to shame them when they have abused their moderator powers, i.e. removing the
ability to send messages for certain users. The main
functions are to unban, invite and give roles to users who have been (unfairly)
admin abused. To keep the admins accountable, a daily tally is kept for the
number of admin abuses. It also features a handful or more lighthearted
functions including a Markov Chain chatbot which responds randomly to
messages, gradually learning how to speak (mostly nonsense) from the users
in the server.

### Technology

Python, Discord.py
