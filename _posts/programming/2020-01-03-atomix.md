atomix is a terminal based atomic data viewer. Written in C, atomix
uses the ncurses library to provide a simple, but efficient user interface.
The purpose of atomix is to provide a way to browse and gain intuition
of the atomic data files used in Python. As such, it has quite a niche
use case and requires Python to be installed to be used to it's fullest.
However, it is still possible to play around with test data provided with
the program and it can also be told to search a directory for Python compatible
atomic data.
