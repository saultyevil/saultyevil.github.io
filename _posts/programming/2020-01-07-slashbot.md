Slashbot is a Discord robot written using Disnake. It was originally written to
automatically moderate moderators, and to shame them for abusing their powers.
But it has since evolved into a robot which spams your Discord server with
~~useless~~ embeds and Markov Chain generated messages, which use the chat
in the server as input.



#### Technology

Python, discord.py
