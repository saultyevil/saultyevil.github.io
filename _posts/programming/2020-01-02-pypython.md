pypython is a python package developed to make using Python a bit easier. It was
originally a way to standardise plots and analysis for Python models, to
avoid creating bespoke scripts for each model/project. At the heart of pypython
is the idea of having flexible functions to suit plotting as many models as
possible. pypython has now evolved, for better or worse, into a beast of its own
and has become a fully-featured companion for Python. pypython features scripts
to create and run a grid of models, including basic logging and email
notification functionalities to keep track of the progress of simulations.
Various utility scripts and functions are also included to deal with otherwise
tedious tasks associated with using python and scientific computing in general.
