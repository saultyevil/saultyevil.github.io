#### Description

pypython is a python package developed to make using Python that bit easier. It was
originally a way for me to standardise plots and analysis for Python models, to
avoid creating bespoke scripts for each model or project. At the heart of pypython
is the idea of having flexible functions to suit plotting as many models as possible.
pypython has now evolved, for better or worse, into a beast of its own and has become
a fully-featured companion for Python. For example, pypython features scripts to create
and run a grid of models, including basic logging and notification functionalities to
keep track of the progress of simulations. Various utility scripts and functions
are also included to deal with otherwise tedious tasks associated with using PYTHON
and scientific computing in general.
