#### Description

Kris is a simple terminal based text editor written in C, implementing
it's own TUI interface, rather than using something sane like ncurses.
It is based on the text editor Kilo and supports reading from and writing
to disk. Kris also features basic syntax highlighting for C, Fortran
and Python and includes a rudimentary search function for the text
buffer. The project is named after my cat.
