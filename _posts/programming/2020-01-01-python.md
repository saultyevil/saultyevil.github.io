#### Description

Python is a (confusingly named) state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radative transfer
and ionization code written in (mostly pre-ANSI) C. Currently under active development,
Python has been around since the mid-90's and developed by Knox Long,
Christian Knigge, Stuart Sim, Nick Higginbottom, James Matthews, Sam Mangham,
Mandy Hewitt and me. PYTHON has a flexible interface for inputting your own
computational grids, or can be configured to use several hard-wired, but parameterised,
kinematic models. It has been used for a variety of research projects
involving the winds, but not limited to, of cataclysmic variables,
active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events.

#### Technology

C, GNU Science Library, Message Passing Interface, Python
