#### Description

Python is a (confusingly named) state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radative transfer
and ionization software suite written in (mostly pre-ANSI) C. Currently under
active development, Python has been around since the mid-90's developed by Knox
Long, Christian Knigge, Stuart Sim, Nick Higginbottom, James Matthews,
Sam Mangham, Mandy Hewitt and me. Python has a flexible interface for inputting
your own computational grids, or can be configured to use several hard-wired,
but parameterised, kinematic models. It has been used for a variety of research
projects involving the winds, but not limited to, of cataclysmic variables,
active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events.

#### Technology

C, CMake, GNU Science Library, MPI, Python (the language), Sphinx
