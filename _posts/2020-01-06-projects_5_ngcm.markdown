As part of the Next Generational Modelling Centre of Doctoral Training (NGCM-CDT),
the first year of my PhD included a taught masters year in computational and
numerical techniques. On the left is some simulated hair, created by solving a 
system of differential equations.

Below are some of the projects which I worked on during
my taught course.
