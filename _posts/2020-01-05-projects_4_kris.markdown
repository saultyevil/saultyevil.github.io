Kris is a simple terminal based text editor written in C, based on the text
editor Kilo. Kris supports reading and writing files, as well as including
syntax highlighting for C, Fortran and Python and the ability to dynamically
search the texxt buffer. The project is named after my cat, Kris. Here is a 
*very* cute picture of him.
