In prep.

Tidal disruption events (TDEs) turn out to be surprisingly luminous at optical
and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. One model for this optical excess proposes that
thermal X-ray emission from a compact accretion disc is reprocessed to longer
wavelengths by an optically thick envelope. We explore this reprocessing scenario
and its role on the formation of UV and optical features within the context of
an optically thick accretion disc wind. Using a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo
radiative transfer and ionization code, we produce synthetic UV and optical
spectra for wind and disc-hosting TDEs. Our models are inspired by observations,
spanning a realistic range of accretion rates and wind kinematics. We find that
such outflows can efficiently reprocess the disc emission and naturally produce
the broad Balmer and Helium recombination features commonly seen in TDEs.
The emission lines feature an asymmetric red wing, with electron scattering
having a dramatic influence on their profiles. Moreover, the characteristic
colour temperature of the reprocessed spectral energy distribution (SED) is
much lower than that of the accretion disc. We show explicitly how changes
in black hole mass, accretion rate and wind properties affect the observed
broadband SED and line spectrum. In general, slower, denser winds reprocess
more radiation and produce stronger Balmer emission. Most of the outflows we
consider are too highly ionized to produce UV absorption features. This is
sensitive to the input SED. For example, truncating the inner disk at just
4 ~ ISCO lowers the wind ionization state sufficiently to produce UV absorption
features for sight lines looking into the wind.

Some tidal disruption events (TDEs) exhibit blueshifted broad absorption lines
(BALs) in their rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectra, while others display broad
emission lines (BELs). Similar phenomenology is observed in quasars and accreting
white dwarfs, where it can be interpreted as an orientation effect associated with
line formation in an accretion disc wind. We propose and explore a similar unification
scheme for TDEs. We present synthetic UV spectra for disc and wind-hosting TDEs,
produced by a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo ionization and radiative transfer code.
Our models cover a wide range of disc wind geometries and kinematics. Such winds
naturally reproduce both BALs and BELs. In general, sightlines looking into the
wind cone preferentially produce BALs, while other orientations preferentially
produce BELs. We also study the effect of wind clumping and CNO-processed abundances
on the observed spectra. Clumpy winds tend to produce stronger UV emission and
absorption lines, because clumping increases both the emission measure and the
abundances of the relevant ionic species, the latter by reducing the ionization
state of the outflow. The main effect of adopting CNO-processed abundances is a
weakening of C IV 1550 Å and an enhancement of N V 1240 Å in the spectra. We
conclude that line formation in an accretion disc wind is a promising mechanism
for explaining the diverse UV spectra of TDEs. If this is correct, the relative
number of BAL and BEL TDEs can be used to estimate the covering factor of the
outflow. The models in this work are publicly available online and upon request.

# Adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations of two-dimensional inviscid extragalatic jets
<!-- {: style="text-align: justify" } -->

Masters thesis available upon request.
<!-- {: style="text-align: justify"} -->

The aims of this project are to explore how perturbing pulses interact in
extragalactic jets, focusing on the oscillatory behaviour of the shock fronts.
This is done by using a simple 2d hydrodynamical model used to model inviscid,
axisymmetric jets using the software PLUTO. Light, low Mach number jets are
simulated over a range of pressure ratios to create overexpanded, underexpanded
and pressure matched jets. The pulses are sinusoidal patterns with varying
amplitudes and frequencies. These pulses develop cause shock fronts with higher
strength than those of the internal jet shock fronts. Pulses are found to eject
jet material into the ambient medium and can severely disrupt the structure of
some jets. Simulations show an interesting behaviour where pulses cause internal
shock fronts to move within the jet structure. It's found that for pulses with
an amplitude of F = 0.5 and frequency of ω = π cause the largest shock front
movement and that the length of pulse injection affects the total amount of
shock front movement. It is proposed that a feedback loop of turbulent energy
from the pulses and ejected jet material, as it is entrained back into the jet,
is the source of this shock front oscillation.

# Measuring proper motions of nearby stars and brown dwarfs
<!-- {: style="text-align: justify" } -->

Bachelors thesis available upon request.
<!-- {: style="text-align: justify" } -->

This project aimed to find nearby stars and brown dwarfs by searching for high
proper motion stars which are objects that move with a large angular displacement
across the sky each year. Candidate stars were found using H2-K images
from the UKIDSS GPS and UWISH2. The spectral type and distance of these objects
was also determined by using their JHK magnitudes from UKIDSS GPS, colour indices
and the distance modulus. The highest proper motion object found had µ = 97 ± 38 mas/yr
and was found to be 39 ± 9 parsecs away, hence no  high proper motion objects
were found. The majority of objects found were M type stars but 2 L-type brown dwarfs
were found. These L-type dwarfs were also the closest with distances at 3 ± 1 and
6 ± 1 parsecs. These two objects were determined to be unreliable/unrealistic
discoveries as they were close to the saturation limit of the detector which can
result in inaccurate magnitude measurements.
