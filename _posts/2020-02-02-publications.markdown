In prep.

Tidal disruption events (TDEs) turn out to be surprisingly luminous at optical and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. One model for this optical excess proposes that thermal X-ray emission from an accretion disc is reprocessed to longer wavelengths by an optically thick envelope - shifting the peak of the spectrum. We explore this reprocessing scenario and its role on the formation of UV and optical features within the context of an optically thick accretion disc wind. Using a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer and ionization code, we produce synthetic UV and optical spectra for wind and disc-hosting TDEs. Our models span a realistic range of accretion rates and wind kinematics inspired by observations. We find that such winds produce both the UV and optical features commonly seen in TDE spectra. Emission from the accretion disc is reprocessed by the wind and plays a key role in the formation of the optical spectrum. Variations in the kinematics of the wind, as well as the accretion rate, change the amount of reprocessing and ionization state of the wind, consequently affecting the strength of spectral features. Specifically, we find that the amount of reprocessing and optical line luminosity increases for winds with higher optical depths. Finally, we find for our range of black hole masses and accretion rates that the outflow is easily overionized, preventing the formation of UV absorption features. The models in this work are publicly available and upon request.

Some tidal disruption events (TDEs) exhibit blueshifted broad absorption lines (BALs) in their rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectra, while others display broad emission lines (BELs). Similar phenomenology is observed in quasars and accreting white dwarfs, where it can be interpreted as an orientation effect associated with line formation in an accretion disc wind. We propose and explore a similar unification scheme for TDEs. We present synthetic UV spectra for disc and wind-hosting TDEs, produced by a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo ionization and radiative transfer code. Our models cover a wide range of disc wind geometries and kinematics. Such winds naturally reproduce both BALs and BELs. In general, sightlines looking into the wind cone preferentially produce BALs, while other orientations preferentially produce BELs. We also study the effect of wind clumping and CNO-processed abundances on the observed spectra. Clumpy winds tend to produce stronger UV emission and absorption lines, because clumping increases both the emission measure and the abundances of the relevant ionic species, the latter by reducing the ionization state of the outflow. The main effect of adopting CNO-processed abundances is a weakening of C IV 1550 Å and an enhancement of N V 1240 Å in the spectra. We conclude that line formation in an accretion disc wind is a promising mechanism for explaining the diverse UV spectra of TDEs. If this is correct, the relative number of BAL and BEL TDEs can be used to estimate the covering factor of the outflow. The models in this work are publicly available online and upon request.

# Adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations of two-dimensional inviscid extragalatic jets
{: style="text-align: justify" }

Masters thesis available upon request.
{: style="text-align: justify"}

The aims of this project are to explore how perturbing pulses interact in 
extragalactic jets, focusing on the oscillatory behaviour of the shock fronts. 
This is done by using a simple 2d hydrodynamical model used to model inviscid, 
axisymmetric jets using the software PLUTO. Light, low Mach number jets are 
simulated over a range of pressure ratios to create overexpanded, underexpanded 
and pressure matched jets. The pulses are sinusoidal patterns with varying 
amplitudes and frequencies. These pulses develop cause shock fronts with higher
strength than those of the internal jet shock fronts. Pulses are found to eject
jet material into the ambient medium and can severely disrupt the structure of
some jets. Simulations show an interesting behaviour where pulses cause internal
shock fronts to move within the jet structure. It's found that for pulses with 
an amplitude of F = 0.5 and frequency of ω = π cause the largest shock front 
movement and that the length of pulse injection affects the total amount of 
shock front movement. It is proposed that a feedback loop of turbulent energy 
from the pulses and ejected jet material, as it is entrained back into the jet, 
is the source of this shock front oscillation.

# Measuring proper motions of nearby stars and brown dwarfs
{: style="text-align: justify" }

Bachelors thesis available upon request.
{: style="text-align: justify" }

This project aimed to find nearby stars and brown dwarfs by searching for high
proper motion stars which are objects that move with a large angular displacement
across the sky each year. Candidate stars were found using H2-K images 
from the UKIDSS GPS and UWISH2. The spectral type and distance of these objects 
was also determined by using their JHK magnitudes from UKIDSS GPS, colour indices 
and the distance modulus. The highest proper motion object found had µ = 97 ± 38 mas/yr 
and was found to be 39 ± 9 parsecs away, hence no  high proper motion objects 
were found. The majority of objects found were M type stars but 2 L-type brown dwarfs 
were found. These L-type dwarfs were also the closest with distances at 3 ± 1 and 
6 ± 1 parsecs. These two objects were determined to be unreliable/unrealistic 
discoveries as they were close to the saturation limit of the detector which can 
result in inaccurate magnitude measurements.
