        atomix is a terminal based atomic data viewer for Python, written in C 
        using the ncurses library. The puropse of atomix is to browse the atomic
        data files using in PYTHON and as such requires PYTHON to be installed
        to be used fully - although test data has been provided in the atomix
        repoistory.

Kris is a simple terminal based text editor written in C, based on the text
editor Kilo. Kris supports reading and writing files, as well as including
syntax highlighting for C, Fortran and Python and the ability to dynamically
search the texxt buffer. The project is named after my cat, Kris. Here is a 
*very* cute picture of him.

# Next Generational Computational Modelling

As part of the Next Generational Modelling Centre of Doctoral Training (NGCM-CDT),
the first year of my PhD included a taught masters year in computational and
numerical techniques. The image is of some simulated hair, created by solving a 
system of differential equations.ss

Below are some of the projects which I worked on during
my taught course.
