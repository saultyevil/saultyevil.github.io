# PYTHON - a Monte Carlo radative transfer and ionization code

<img src="../img/github.png" alt="" width="28"/> [Python](https://github.com/saultyevil/python)

PYTHON is a (confusingly named) state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radative transfer 
and ionization code written in C. Currently still in "beta", PYTHON has been
actively developed since the 90's by Knox Long, Christian Knigge, Stuart Sim, 
Nick Higginbottom, James Matthews, Sam Mangham and me. PYTHON has been used for a
variaty of research projects involving the winds of cataclysmic variables, young
stellar objects, active galactic nuclei, X-ray binaries and tidal disruption 
events.

# pyPython - a python package for PYTHON

<img src="../img/github.png" alt="" width="28"/> [pyPython](https://github.com/saultyevil/pypython)

pyPython is a python package developed to make using PYTHON easier. pyPython was 
orignally a way for me to standardize plots and analysis for PYTHON models, whilst
trying to avoid creating custom scripts for each model. At the heart of pyPython
is the idea of having flexible functions to suit as many models as possible. pyPython
has now evolved into a beast of its own and has become a fully-featured companion
from PYTHON. For example, pyPython features scripts to create and run a grid of
models, including basic logging and notification systems to keep track of the
progress of currently running simulations. Various utility scripts and functions
are also included to deal with otherwise teadious tasks associated with using PYTHON
and scientific computing in general.

# atomix - a terminal based tool to browse atomic data files

            atomix is a terminal based atomic data viewer. Written in C, atomix
            uses the ncurses library to provide a user interface. The puropse of
            atomix is to provide a way to browse and gain intuition of the atomic
            data files used in PYTHON. As such, it has quite a niche use case and
            requires PYTHON to be installed to be used to it's fullest. However,
            it is still possible to play around with test data provided with the
            program and can be told to search a directory for PYTHON compatible
            atomic data.

            Kris is a simple terminal based text editor written in C using the ncurses
            library. It is based on the text editor Kilo. Kris supports reading as well as writing
            to file. Kris also features syntax highlighting for C, Fortran and Python and inlucdes
            a rudimentary search function for the text buffer. The project is named after my 
            cat, Kris. Here is a <i>lovely</i> picture of him.

# Next Generational Computational Modelling

As part of the Next Generational Modelling Centre of Doctoral Training (NGCM-CDT),
the first year of my PhD included a taught masters year in computational and
numerical techniques. The image is of some simulated hair, created by solving a 
system of differential equations using the shooting method. Below are some of the
projects which I worked on during the course.
