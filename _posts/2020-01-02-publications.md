A significant number of tidal disruption events (TDEs) radiate primarily at optical and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, with only weak soft X-ray components. One model for this optical excess proposes that thermal X-ray emission from a compact accretion disc is reprocessed to longer wavelengths by an optically thick envelope. Here, we explore this reprocessing scenario in the context of an optically thick accretion disc wind. Using a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer and ionization code, we produce synthetic UV and optical spectra for wind and disc-hosting TDEs. Our models are inspired by observations, spanning a realistic range of accretion rates and wind kinematics. We find that such outflows can efficiently reprocess the disc emission and produce the broad Balmer and helium recombination features commonly seen in TDEs. The emission lines feature an asymmetric red wing, with electron scattering having a dramatic influence on their profiles. Moreover, the characteristic colour temperature of the reprocessed spectral energy distribution (SED) is much lower than that of the accretion disc. We show explicitly how changes in black hole mass, accretion rate and wind properties affect the observed broadband SED and line spectrum. In general, slower, denser winds tend to reprocess more radiation and produce stronger Balmer emission. Most of the outflows we consider are too highly ionized to produce UV absorption features, but this is sensitive to the input SED. For example, truncating the inner disc at just 4 ~ ISCO lowers the wind ionization state sufficiently to produce UV absorption features for sight lines looking into the wind.

Some tidal disruption events (TDEs) exhibit blueshifted broad absorption lines
(BALs) in their rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectra, while others display broad
emission lines (BELs). Similar phenomenology is observed in quasars and accreting
white dwarfs, where it can be interpreted as an orientation effect associated with
line formation in an accretion disc wind. We propose and explore a similar unification
scheme for TDEs. We present synthetic UV spectra for disc and wind-hosting TDEs,
produced by a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo ionization and radiative transfer code.
Our models cover a wide range of disc wind geometries and kinematics. Such winds
naturally reproduce both BALs and BELs. In general, sightlines looking into the
wind cone preferentially produce BALs, while other orientations preferentially
produce BELs. We also study the effect of wind clumping and CNO-processed abundances
on the observed spectra. Clumpy winds tend to produce stronger UV emission and
absorption lines, because clumping increases both the emission measure and the
abundances of the relevant ionic species, the latter by reducing the ionization
state of the outflow. The main effect of adopting CNO-processed abundances is a
weakening of C IV 1550 Å and an enhancement of N V 1240 Å in the spectra. We
conclude that line formation in an accretion disc wind is a promising mechanism
for explaining the diverse UV spectra of TDEs. If this is correct, the relative
number of BAL and BEL TDEs can be used to estimate the covering factor of the
outflow. The models in this work are publicly available online and upon request.
