Research Software Engineer, part of the [Southampton Research Software
Group](https://rsgsoton.net/) at the University of Southampton. Passionate about
improving the quality and reproducibility of software in research, especially
in legacy code bases in astrophysics. Involved in multiple projects, from HPC
and machine learning, to modern web and app development.

Completed a Ph.D. in Computational Astrophysics with the
[Next Generation Computational Modelling Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.ngcm.soton.ac.uk/)
at the University of Southampton, under the supervision of
[Prof. Christian Knigge](https://www.phys.soton.ac.uk/people/ck7).
Confronted theory with observations using novel radiative transfer simulations,
to simulate the journey of light emitted when a star is ripped apart by a
supermassive black hole, in something known as a tidal disruption event.

<!-- During my PhD, I had excellent opportunity to build my computational and
communication skills, attending international workshops and conferences to
share my work with the community and have had the opportunity to work in
international collaborations. At Southampton, I have had access to world-class
HPC facilities and training in a wide range of programming languages and
frameworks such as, but not limited to, C, MPI, CUDA, TensorFlow and Python. I
worked with vast quantities of synthetic and real world data, applying a modern
toolkit of data analysis techniques, statistical modelling, Python/R frameworks
and numerical techniques to confront theory with observations, producing novel
and state-of-the-art research. I have been the principle investigator for
multiple collaborative and individual research projects and a key team member
in cross-disciplinary collaborations and projects. -->
