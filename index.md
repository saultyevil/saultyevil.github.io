I am a Research Software Engineer, part of the Southampton Research
Software Group at the University of Southampton. I completed my Ph.D in Next
Generation Computational Modelling at the University of Southampton, under
the supervision of Professor Christian Knigge, in 2022. My research consisted of
simulation the light emitted when a star is ripped apart by a black hole,
in something known as a tidal disruption event. I completed my
integrated masters in physics with astrophysics at the University of Kent,
specialising in hydrodynamics, first class with honours in 2016.

During my PhD, I had excellent opportunity to build my computational and
communication skills, attending international workshops and conferences to
share my work with the community and have had the opportunity to work in
international collaborations. At Southampton, I have had access to world-class
HPC facilities and training in a wide range of programming languages and
frameworks such as, but not limited to, C, MPI, CUDA, TensorFlow and Python. I
worked with vast quantities of synthetic and real world data, applying a modern
toolkit of data analysis techniques, statistical modelling, Python/R frameworks
and numerical techniques to confront theory with observations, producing novel
and state-of-the-art research. I have been the principle investigator for
multiple collaborative and individual research projects and a key team member
in cross-disciplinary collaborations and projects.
