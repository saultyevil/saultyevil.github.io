<h3>Statement</h3>
<p>I am a Research Software Engineer, embedded in the Research Software Group at the University of Southampton. Before my position, I was a PhD student at the University of Southampton, simulating the light emitted when a star is ripped apart by a black hole, in something known as a Tidal Disruption Event. I was part of the Next Generational Computational Modelling Centre for Doctoral Training (NGCM-CDT) based at the University of Southampton, where I trained in modern computational techniques and numerical modelling. I completed my masters in physics with astrophysics at the University of Kent where I graduated first class with honours in 2016, specialising in fluid dynamic simulations of jetted material ejected from galaxies. During my PhD, I have had the opportunity to build my computational, HPC and communication skills, attending international workshops and conferences to share my work with and learn from the community. I worked with vast quantities of synthetic and real world data, applying a modern toolkit of data analysis techniques, statistical modelling, Python/R frameworks and numerical techniques to confront theory with observations, producing novel and state-of-the-art research. I have been the principle investigator for multiple collaborative and individual research projects and a key team member in cross-disciplinary collaborations and projects.</p>
