          I am currently a PhD student spending my time researching optical and UV
          line formation in Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs), under the supervision
          of Christian Knigge at the University of Southampton. To do my research,
          I use the Monte Carlo method to individually simulate the passage of
          millions of photons to model the radiative transfer of light through
          dense, and optically thick, outflows.
          <br><br>
          I am part of the Next Generational Computational Modelling Centre for
          Doctoral Training (<a href="https://www.ngcm.soton.ac.uk">NGCM-CDT</a>)
          and also the Computational Modelling Group, both at the University of
          Southampton. I completed my integrated masters in physics with astrophysics
          at the University of Kent, graduating in 2016. In my masters year, I
          specialised in hydrodynamical modelling of jets in radio galaxies.
          <br><br>
          Throughout my PhD, I have had plenty of opportunities to build my skills,
          attending national and international workshops and conferences,
          enabling me to share my work with the wider community. With the NGCM,
          I have had access to world-class HPC facilities and training in a wide
          range of programming languages and frameworks such as, but not limited
          to, C, FORTRAN, CUDA, MPI and multiple acceleration frameworks for
          Python.
