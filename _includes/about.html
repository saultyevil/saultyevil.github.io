            I'm currently a PhD student researching line formation  
            in Tidal Disruption Events using Monte Carlo radiative transfer
            and ionization simulation, modelling their ionized outflows in. I am
            conducting my research at the University of Southampton under the
            supervsion of Christian Knigge. At Southampton, I'm part of the
            Computational Modelling Group and the Next Generation Computational 
            Modelling Centre for Doctoral Training (NGCM-CDT). I completed my 
            integrated masters in physics at the University of Kent, finishing
            first class with honours. For my bachelor's disseration, I
            created a simple script to search for High Proper Motion stars in the
            UKIDSS-GPS and UWISH2 survey data. My masters thesis focused on 
            inviscid hydrodynamics simulations of extragalactic jets using PLUTO.

            During the course of my PhD, I have attended both national and 
            international workshops and conferences, sharing my work with the
            wider astronomy community. With the NGCM, I have had the opportunity
            to work with world-leading HPC facilities using, and training in, a 
            wide range of programming languages and parallelisation/HPC frameworks,
            such as, but not limited to, CUDA, OpenMP and MPI.
