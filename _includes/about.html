                I am currently a PhD student researching line formation in 
                outflows in Tidal Disruption Events using Monte Carlo radiative
                transfer and ionization simulations. I currently attend the
                University of Southampton and are supervised by Christian Knigge.
                I belong to the Next Generation Compuational Modelling Centre for 
                Doctoral Training (NGCM-CDT). During my PhD and as part of the 
                NGCM, I have worked with HPC facilities using a range of programming
                languages and parallelisation and HPC frameworks, such as CUDA 
                and MPI.
