        I'm a PhD student currently researching optical and UV line formation  
        in Tidal Disruption Events, using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer
        and ionization code PYTHON to model ionized outflows in TDEs. I'm
        currently part of the Department of Physics and Astrophysics at the University
        of Southampton, under the supervsion of Professor Christian Knigge. 
        I'm also part of the Computational Modelling Group and the Next Generational
        Computational Modelling Centre for Doctoral Training (NGCM-CDT) at Southampton.
        I completed my integrated masters in physics with astrophysics at the University of
        Kent, finishing first class with honours.

        During my PhD, I have had the opportunity to attend both national and 
        international workshops and conferences, enabling me to share my work with
        the wider community. With the NGCM, I've been able to work with world-class
        HPC facilities using, and training in, a wide range of programming languages 
        and parallelisation/HPC frameworks, such as, but not limited to, CUDA, OpenMP
        and MPI.
        <br><br>
        My bachelor's disseration focused on identifying high proper motion stars,
        where I created a script to process candidate objects in UKIDSS-GPS and UWISH2
        survey data. My masters thesis, was more theoretical and centred on hydrodynamic 
        simulationsof extragalactic jets, using the astrophysical fluid dynamics code PLUTO.
