            I am a PhD student at the University of Southampton, under the supervision of Christian Knigge, 
            simulating the light emitted when a star is ripped apart by a black hole, in something known as a 
            Tidal Disruption Event. I am part of the Next Generational Computational Modelling Centre for Doctoral 
            Training (<a href="https://www.ngcm.soton.ac.uk">NGCM-CDT</a>) and also the Computational Modelling Group, 
            both based at the University of Southampton. I completed my integrated masters in physics with astrophysics 
            at the University of Kent, graduating first class with honours in 2016. In my masters year, I
            specialized in hydrodynamical modelling of jets in radio galaxies.

            During my PhD, I have had the opportunity to build my computational and communication skills, attending 
            international workshops and conferences to share my work with the community and have had the opportunity to 
            work in international collaborations. At Southampton, I have had access to world-class HPC facilities and 
            training in a wide range of programming languages and frameworks such as, but not limited to, C,
            MPI, CUDA, TensorFlow and Python. I worked with vast quantities of synthetic and real world data, applying a 
            modern toolkit of data analysis techniques, statistical modelling, Python/R frameworks and numerical 
            techniques to confront theory with observations, producing novel and state-of-the-art research. I have been 
            the principle investigator for multiple collaborative and individual research projects and a key team member 
            in cross-disciplinary collaborations and projects.
            <br><br>
            I am now looking to use and improve the skills which I developed during my PhD in roles outside of academia, 
            where I can use data to solve real world problems in our data driven world. 
            To contact me, I can currently be emailed through my university email,
            <a href="mailto:e.j.parkinson@soton.ac.uk">e.j.parkinson@soton.ac.uk</a>, or using my personal email,
